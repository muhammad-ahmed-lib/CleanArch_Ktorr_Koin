1. Clean Architecture
Description: Clean Architecture, proposed by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob), emphasizes the separation of concerns and promotes a highly decoupled system. It organizes code into different layers, making the codebase more maintainable, testable, and scalable.

Layers:

Presentation Layer: Contains the UI and the logic related to presenting data to the user.

Domain Layer: Encapsulates business logic and rules. This layer is independent of any framework or library, making it reusable and testable.

Data Layer: Handles data sources, such as network responses and local databases. It contains repository implementations that provide data to the domain layer.

Principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class should have one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the application.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

2. Ktor
Description: Ktor is a Kotlin framework for building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems. It is designed to be flexible and easy to use, making it suitable for microservices, web applications, and APIs.

Features:

Asynchronous: Uses coroutines for non-blocking operations.

Modular: Offers various modules that can be included or excluded as needed.

Extensible: Allows customization through features and plugins.

3. Dependency Injection (Koin)
Description: Koin is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin. It is designed to be simple and straightforward, providing an idiomatic way to declare dependencies and inject them into your application components.

Features:

DSL: Uses a Kotlin DSL to define modules and dependencies.

No Proxy: Koin does not rely on bytecode manipulation or proxies, ensuring a lightweight footprint.

Scopes: Supports scopes for dependency lifecycles.
